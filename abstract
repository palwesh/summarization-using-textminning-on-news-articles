Web has millions of documents on any topic.
It is very difficult for anyone to read hundreds of documents to understand knowledge about any event.  My research aims to
mine one Indian newspaper stories about events to create “automatic” summaries about events with a maximum length of two pages
[about 30 statements]. The techniques that are going to be used are [1] keyword extraction [2] categorization or clustering
[3] filtering of documents based on categorization [4] summarization using important sentence extraction.  We would be planning
to use the content of one year’s archive of the Indian newspaper ‘The Hindu’.
