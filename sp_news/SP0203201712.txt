‘Having new players the opposition isn’t familiar with adds a string to your bow’

Australia opener David Warner on Wednesday praised his junior partner Matthew Renshaw for catching the Indian team off guard with his gutsy performance in the first Test despite being under the weather.

The 20-year-old, on his first tour of India, had scores of 68 and 31 despite suffering from an upset stomach and dizziness which required medical attention.

“First Test match in India, India probably didn’t expect that. We have never seen him [Renshaw] play in these conditions as well. That’s the good thing about this game. When you have fresh people in the team, you don’t know what they are capable of as well and it adds another string to your bow,” said Warner.

“He played fantastic. It could have been a different story if he stayed out there or he didn’t come off [in first innings] but the way he played and the way he adapted from coming off, being sick and going back out there was credit to him.”

Warner said the week-long training in Dubai before arriving in India was the best thing that could have happened to the team.

Dubai prep


“Having that week in Dubai and having freshened up as well after our summer was fantastic for me and my preparation.

“And I know the guys that went to Dubai early, they were all talking about how good it was to prepare over there and get their mind set and get the miles in the legs to come here,” Warner said.

The dashing opener feels that staying in Dubai helped them overcome the fatigue factor.
