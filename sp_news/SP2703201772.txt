 India take slender first-innings lead of 32
Top Developments

    India go into lunch on the 3rd day with a slender lead of 32. Australia took the last four India wickets for just 15 runs shortly before the break. Jadeja scored 63, Lyon finished with 5 for 92

What a turnaround for Australia before lunch. With half an hour to go, they looked jaded and frustrated, with Jadeja and Saha batting on. Jadeja's wicket opened the floodgates and India lost their last 4 wickets for 15 runs. Jadeja did well to take India past 300. India have a slender lead of 32. They will be disappointed. How will Australia fare on the third-day pitch? We'll find out after lunch.

UPDATES

Australia 31/3 - WICKET - Renshaw c Saha b Umesh 8

Australia have already lost three before wiping out the deficit! Indian seamers on a roll. It was short of a length on the off stump, Renshaw went back to defend, tamely pushed at it and Saha did the rest

Australia 31/2 - WICKET - Smith b Bhuvneshwar 17

Timber! Bhuvneshwar has got the Big Fish! Steve Smith attempts a third consecutive boundary off Bhuvneshwar but ends up dragging the ball from outside off and getting a big inside edge, the off stump goes for a short spin and lands a few yards back

The Indian fast bowlers too are digging it in short. Warner had to fend off some nasty bouncers

3.1 overs - WICKET - Australia 10/1 Warner c Saha b Umesh 6

Well the drop in the previous over didn't cost India anything! Umesh over the wicket, on the channel outside the off stump, Warner gets a thin edge, looks back, didn't need to review it. Karun Nair will be a relieved man for sure
