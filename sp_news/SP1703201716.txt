Substitute Muhammed Parakkottil’s twin strikes keeps his side in the hunt for semifinal spot

It looked like the last roll of the dice when Muhammed Parakkottil was brought on as substitute in the 69th minute. However, the diminutive under-21 striker seized the opportunity, and his twin strikes in five minutes snatched an unlikely draw for Kerala against Punjab in a group-B match at the GMC Stadium in Bambolim on Friday.

Muhammed struck in the 89th and 94th minutes as Kerala erased a two-goal deficit to keep its semifinal hopes alive. Punjab continues to lead the table with seven points from three matches.

Punjab paid the price for being overly defensive after going 2-0 up early in the second half.

Muhammed got the breakthrough goal in the 89th minute when his glancing header off a fine cross from Jobby Justin was bang on target. With the Kerala strikers swarming the Punjab citadel in the five minutes of extra-time, the second goal came off a throw-in after the Punjab goalie blasted the ball out to waste time. Sreerag’s throw-in was flicked towards the goalmouth by Jijo Joseph, and Muhammed was at hand to slot it in.

The opening goal came in the 49th minute when Amandeep broke through from the left flank and then squared the ball towards Vijay Kumar. But before the ball could reach the striker, Kerala defender Sherin Sam rushed in and intercepted the ball only managing to guide it into his own net.

The second Punjab goal was more authoritative. A long diagonal ball from the middle split the defence and came to Manvir Singh who beat two defenders and scored with a right-footer.

The results: Kerala 2 (Mohammad 89, 94) drew with Punjab 2 (Serin 49-OG, Manvir 57).
