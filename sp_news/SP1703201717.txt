Mata nets winner; Pogba’s injury puts a dampener on the win

Manchester United, which held Rostov 1-1 on a difficult pitch in the first-leg, needed a 70th minute goal from Juan Mata, who turned the ball home from Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s back-heel, and two good saves from Sergio Romero.

However, midfielder Paul Pogba was forced off with an injury in the second half, putting a dampener on the win which took it to the quarterfinals of the Europa League.
