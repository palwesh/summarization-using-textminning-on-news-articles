‘We have the momentum going into the final Test’

Australia captain Steve Smith said he was proud of his team’s fightback on the final day.

“They [Handscomb and Marsh] backed their defence for long periods of time and to see the game out for as long as they did was an outstanding performance.

“That’s one of the things we’ve been talking about — being resilient and sticking out the tough times. The two were magnificent.”

Smith said his team had the momentum going into the decider at Dharamshala.

“If there’s anything called momentum it’s with us at the moment. India coming today would have expected to bowl us out. I am sure they’re hurting a little bit in their change room.”

Dwelling on Handscomb, Smith said, “He’s looked very good in every game so far without going on to make a score. Today the way he did that, his innings is worth 140 in my eyes.”

Smith said the pitch played better than it looked and added, “Pujara and Saha batted exceptionally well. It was a long time in the field.

“Credit to our boys the way they came out today after having such heavy legs to be able to hold out for the draw.”

On Ishant Sharma getting annoyed on the field, Smith revealed, “Vijay, at midwicket, moved a few steps to his left as the bowler was running in. It put Renshaw off and he was entitled to back away. I’m not sure what happened with Ishant, he wasn’t happy overall.

“He got angry and bowled fairly well after that.”

Smith said the India-Australia matches were invariably hard fought.

“There’s always a little bit of tension when Australia and India are playing in Test matches.

“As far as I’m concerned it’s being played in the right spirit on the field, it’s been a tough hard grind.

“That’s how I would explain it, no issue with that.”
