India will not reconsider its five-bowler-strategy merely because of the defeat in Pune, Anil Kumble stated here on Thursday.

India’s batsmen lasted less than 75 overs across both innings as Australia won the first Test inside three days, but Kumble, the home team’s head coach, was clear that a single result did not warrant any big changes.

“I don’t think so. It all depends on what we believe is the right combination to win a Test match. If we believe that four bowlers are enough or five bowlers are needed [then we will do that]. Which five bowlers or which four bowlers...all that depends on what we want. Our aim is to win every game,” he said.

Kumble was asked if Karun Nair could play the second Test, starting here on Saturday, in place of Ajinkya Rahane.

“There’s absolutely no question of dropping Rahane,” the 46-year-old said. “He’s been extremely successful over the last couple of years. In terms of the team composition, we still haven’t discussed that. All 16 are available.

“It’s unfortunate that Karun missed out after he scored that triple hundred (against England). That’s the way the composition of the team has been where we’ve looked to play five bowlers and you know it’s unfortunate...he came in as a replacement. It’s really nice to have these kinds of choices. That’s the beauty about this group: whoever comes in does well.”
