“We felt that awarding the prestigious ISL final to Kochi would be an apt ode to the State’s contribution to Indian football,” said Nita Ambani, chairperson of Football Sports Development Limited, promoter of ISL, while announcing the news on Friday.

Kochi has thrown up the biggest crowds for the ISL this season, with the numbers for Kerala Blasters’s home games often touching 55,000 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.
