    Pujara goes for 57 after the tea break, caught at short leg off Nathan Lyon. Rahul fell in the second session for 60

India scored 89 runs in the second session for the loss of one wicket. Not very different to the morning session, where they lost a wicket as well, though more runs were scored in the afternoon. India are not in a daring hurry, they know they are a batsman short. However, they have stood up to the short deliveries, particularly Rahane. Will they continue at the same rate after tea? There's plenty of time left in this match. Join us for the final session.
