 Mangalore University tallied 178 points for the overall title in the 77th all-India inter-university athletics meet for men and women at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday.

The solid performance of its men, who enjoyed the lion’s share (125) in the points table, helped Mangalore regain the crown, which it last won in 2015.

Rio Olympian Mohan Kumar, who came up with a mesmerising record run in the men’s 400m the other day, stunned the crowd yet again with a couple of scorching runs in both the 200m and the 4x400m.

Official blunder

The B.A. Economics student from D.G. Vaishnav College (Chennai) had his eyes firmly set on former international Anand Natarajan’s 26-year-old ‘hand-timed’ 200m record of 21.3s. He was slow of the blocks, but gathered pace midway to finish in style. It looked a certain record, but an official blunder robbed him of a place in the record books.

It was said that the starter had failed to carry the sensor which ultimately led to the non-functioning of the photo-finish system that all the other events enjoyed. Even otherwise, Kumar had stopped the ‘manual’ clock at 20.99s.

The officials knew it but, after an agonising wait of nearly half-an-hour, the announcement came that he had equalled the meet record with a time of 21.3.

Kumar was clearly disappointed and, the crowd too. Natarajan, who was part of the meet, knew that as well. He showered praises and rewarded Kumar with a cash award of ?50,000.

Later, Kumar anchored the Madras University team to a new record in the men’s 4x400m.
