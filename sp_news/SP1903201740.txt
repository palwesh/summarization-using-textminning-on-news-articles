Goalkeeper sceptical about ISL’s role in game development

The match between the two traditional rivals Bengal and Goa in the 71st edition of the National championship at GMC stadium in Bambolim turned out be a damp squib.

Watching from the stands was one of India’s greatest goalkeepers S. Brahmanand. Like many, he was not impressed with the fare dished out by both teams.

“I didn’t see a single player from either team who could one day become a star,” he said. “The standards have come down drastically.

The former Goa captain and the first footballer from the State to win the Arjuna award said the All India Football Federation’s thinking on the Santosh Trophy was skewed.

“If it is a national tournament I believe the best players in the country should take part in it. The AIFF should revive popular tournaments like the Federation Cup, the Rovers Cup, the Durand Cup, etc if they really want football to improve,” he said.

“Personally, I have great memories of the Santosh Trophy. Playing against some of the greats of Indian football was a challenge. I am still proud of my record in the Santosh Trophy; in 1984 when Goa won the tournament I didn’t concede a single goal,” said the man who was nicknamed ‘The Leopard’.

Brahamanand said he was sceptical about whether the ISL would improve football in the country. “To be honest, I am not in a position to comment on that right now, but I can say that with the advent of the ISL, interest in the I-League has diminished.

“I think Indian players should be given more chances to play in the I-league, and over-dependence on foreigners is not going to help Indian football. The AIFF should ensure that the teams largely field Indian players at least in the second division I-League,” said Brahmanand.
