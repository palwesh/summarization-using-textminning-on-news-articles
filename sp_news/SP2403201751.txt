 Defeats Madras Sporting Union 3-1 thanks to goals from Biswas, Aningo and John Peter

Chennai FC posted its second win of the season, defeating Madras Sporting Union 3-1 in the St. Joseph’s-CFA senior division league here on Thursday.

Chennai drew first blood in the opening minute when Kaushik Biswas put his side ahead with an opportunistic shot from the right that caught the MSU defenders napping. After that goal, the game meandered without either side actually threatening to create any chances.

Chennai, however, was the better side in the first half and just before the break Ericobira Aningo made a good run before he was pulled down by C. Annamalai inside the box. Aningo converted the penalty to make it 2-0 for Chennai.

In the second half, MSU played with purpose. Vittalis pulled one back when he scored from the spot after being brought down by Anurf Younge.

MSU then had a very good chance to equalise when Deepak Rakash received a beautiful cross from Koko from the right, but he was unlucky as the shot hit the side post.

Immediately, against the run of play, G. John Peter dodged past three defenders and ran almost half the field to score Chennai’s third goal and seal the match.

The result: Chennai FC 3 (Kaushik Biswas 1, Ericobira Aningo 44-pen, G. John Peter 83) bt MSU 1 (Vittalis 76-pen).
