Delhi Daredevils yet to name replacement

Delhi Daredevils allrounder JP Duminy has withdrawn from the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL), citing personal reasons. The South African captained the franchise for two games in the 2015 season.

“We respect JP’s decision. We are naturally very disappointed to not have JP in our midst this year, but as a franchise we clearly understand his position,” Delhi Daredevils chief executive Hemant Dua was quoted as saying in a media release. “At this stage, we can only confirm that we will look for a replacement at an appropriate time.”

Duminy didn’t elaborate on what prompted him to sit out the season. “It has been a very difficult decision for me to make, but it was for purely personal reasons. I am grateful for the support and understanding from the franchise. It has been an absolute privilege to have played for and led a talented mix of players. I certainly hope to play a part for the franchise in the near future,” he was quoted as saying in a media release.

Duminy has been prolific for the Daredevils, and is currently the franchise’s fifth highest scorer, with 1015 runs in 38 games with six fifties. South Africa begin their tour of England with a three-match series starting May 24, before the Champions Trophy begins in the same country. The IPL ends on May 21. It’s possible that Duminy would want to stay fresh for South Africa’s international commitments.
